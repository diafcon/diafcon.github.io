## Making a post on the docs.

**Header Sample**

```bash
---
title: "Making a Post"
# subtitle: "Our statement"
date: 2021-10-29
lastmod: 2021-12-09
draft: false

```

Hope Everything is self explanatory, however not all `params` are required. e.g

```bash

---
title: "Setting Up docs app on local machine"
author: anslem
draft: false
date: 2022-11-11
tags:
  - First Issue
categories:

```

You can notice that in the above example, the `lastmod` is not used for example.

```bash
**TODO: Update everyOnce in a while**
```
